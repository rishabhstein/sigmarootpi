<p align="justify">

<i><a href="https://people.well.com/user/jonl/viridiandesign/notes/1-25/Note%2000002.txt">Attention conservation notice:</a></i> Just blaming others for my own problems.<br><br>

So I am writing now in my room thinking about many things as usual. My natural inclination when thinking is toward the phone, which I do not use that much. Conversely, I feel that the iPad is a big trouble now because I am just so comfortable watching tens of videos in one sitting. This is not a good idea for many reasons, including the



algorithm's design to show content repeatedly similar to what was searched or watched before. So, if you watch one video on the German economy, it will start showing the world is in crisis. Ironically, the world is always in crisis somewhere. It is clearly an illusion when someone claims (just for clickbait) that something has never happened before. History is a big contradiction of this argument, as even in the case of Germany, we recall the barbarians and Roman war at the time of the Roman empire when Marcus Aurelius was the king. Germany did not even exist at that time. 

On top of this world-in-crisis idea, YouTube also feeds other stories, and most of them affect my mind quite badly. I think we (me and my thoughts) should clearly take strong action against these attention-sucking algorithms. Once you start using them, it is so hard to break that habbit. <i>And that is why the Phone should be considered a very sacred object, especially nowadays, because it remembers your mental states, urges, and history, plainly speaking</i>. Wittingly, I outsmarted the phones (assumingly) by following a minimalist (both lifestyle and digital) based approach. Accordingly, I deactivated Instagram more than a year ago and Facebook completely around 4-5 months ago, as far as I can remember, but somehow, it is active again (it is not me). I do not miss either of these platforms, and I feel them to be a burden on my mental peace. <i>But I should also warn you here that stopping using social networks does not mean becoming a hermit but finding an alternative approach because the mind does not like boredom, and social media is a good way of ignoring boredom, anxiety and stressful conditions</i>. My alternative approaches are reading books and doing sports. For a general idea, I would say something which is less stimulating and requires effort.

<br><br>
As I mentioned previously, my most recent addiction is YouTube, which is, for sure, a better platform than Facebook and Instagram. However, it also follows a similar approach as Fb and Instagram to keep viewers engaged. I am still not very happy about it due to addictive reasons. Watching YouTube is very much like watching television in old times, but once you start, it is hard to stop. Also, keeping the screen so close could result in developing myopia. So I will update you as soon as I find a solution.
