  <h4>Letter to Anne Frank</h4>
  
<p align="justify">
Dear Anne, <br><br>

I read your diary, <i>Kitty</i>, recently, almost 75 years later, after you wrote it. I must say that you were born as a talented writer. Even in my late twenties, I can't write as well as you did in your diary at the age of thirteen. It was amazing to see the insight you have about life at that age which even many adults don't have at all in their whole life. 



It's hard for me to imagine, how much you, Margot, your parents, Mr. Dussell, Van Dan family, and thousands of people have suffered in the war and I apologize to you for all those unfortunate things done by society. If you would be here today, you must be proud of your accomplishments as a writer. Millions of people read your diary and many famous writers have praised your talent in writing. Who knows, maybe you would have already won the Booker or Noble prize and would have made us all proud. 

You also would be happy to know that now slowly-slowly women are getting stronger or equal to men and we have made so much progress. We went to the moon and also planned to go to Mars. We have invented technologies such as smartphones and the internet. If you would be here, you would be able to listen to your favorite music and take photographs of all the members of <i>Secret Annex</i> using the former. Even in hiding, you would be able to talk to people in other countries, maybe that would have eased some of your hard time. You could have accessed the internet on smartphones which is a revolutionary technology, using which you could be able to read as many books as you want or maybe able to watch a dancing cat video. But Anne, you would also be disappointed in us to know that not only we messed up our home planet, earth but also still secretly follow those strong ideologies which lead to war. In addition to racism and nationalism, new ideology such as Atheism and Veganism emerges in society. <br><br>


You might even know better that any ideology as it grows stronger becomes deadlier. As a vegetarian and former atheist, I saw people arguing that their food ideology is better or the belief of <i>not believing in God</i> is a better belief. Due to environmental change and experiences from previous wars in which you have suffered, It gives me shivers to think about the future and why we all want to be right.  Why don't we let other people live peacefully and let them choose what they want?  Additional to these problems, a pandemic is going on. This time a virus from China spread in the whole world and in spite of the scientific revolution, which many people are proud of, it has created so much trouble. You would be amazed to know what can be done using the internet. The situation of rumors is even worse than your time as the rumors travel faster using the internet than true information. In short, everyone seems more confused yet very confident than even Mr. Dussel and Mr. Van Dan about everything. Anne, the world, even after facing two big wars and so much technological advancement, is still on the verge of being chaotic. <br><br><br>

 

Yours Sincerely<br>
Ryszard
