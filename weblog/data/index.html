Dear Anne, <br><br>


I read your diary, <i>Kitty</i>, recently, almost 75 years later, after you wrote it. I must say that you were born as a talented writer. Even in my late twenties, I can't write as well as you did in your diary at the age of thirteen. It was amazing to see the insight you have about life at that age which even many adults don't have at all in their whole life. It's hard for me to imagine, how much you, Margot, your parents, Mr. Dussell, Van Dan family, and thousands of people have suffered in the war and I apologize to you for all those unfortunate things done by society. If you would be here today, you must be proud of your accomplishments as a writer. Millions of people read your diary and many famous writers have praised your talent in writing. Who knows, maybe you would have already won the Booker or Noble prize and would have made us all proud.

I grew up in a small town of  North-India in a family of science-beliving parents and religious grandparents. As a beloved grandchild, I remember attending many talks of Sadhus (hermits) with my grandfather as well as a disciplined son, attending lectures on Maths and Physics by my father. Exposure to both Science and Philosophy/Mythology made me a scientist who wants to feed his curiosity by asking questions with the eyes of a Philosopher who wants to see the root of every problem.  Till my early 20s, I heard many Indian Gurus (teachers)/Sadhus(hermits) with their amazingly subtle understanding of Hindu religious books as well as those with blind beliefs. What amazes me that whenever I tried to read those religious books, despite my proud nature as a science guy, I fell trap to the blind belief (accepting or rejecting) because of my naivety. This naivety is still among us because of our busy lives and that's the reason some self-proclaimed Sadhus/Gurus take advantage of it which leads to disbelief in thousands of year-old traditions.

It's not very clear what one thinks one wants, or may be it is just an illusion of abundance of choices, among which one think that he can choose a better option. But what is better choice? when the word better is defined only based on limited experiences and resulting perception. A question repeatedly comes to me, asking who am I? Many thinkers tried to answer it including ancient hindus explaining that Aham Brahmasmi&mdash;I am Brahm, the truth, the Sat. Moreover, the idea of Brahma is just an thought based description, without any realization. So all the histories monumental thinkers just wasted their time?
<br><br>

It may be possible!! but on the contrary these thinkers made the world what we see it today.  Democritus argued the world is made of Atoms, a fundamental unit of nature, of which we all are made of. When one dies these atoms merely transforms from one combination to another. Kanada (read as ka+naa+da), an ancient Hindu sage, believed in a similar concept however his  Atoms has properties due to which we observe the differences in material properties.
<br><br>

These observations, despite of being thousands of years old still holds upto certain accuracy with one major difference&mdash;we have not only a general idea of these laws but also a concrete mathematical description. Accordingly, the intuition of earth having an attraction force towards an object&mdash;Aristotle and Aryabhatt hypothesis?&mdash;was validated and formulated by Newton in his inverse-sqaure law. Moreover, in a book The character of Physical Laws, the famous physicist Richarad P.  Feynman argues that the inverse square law can be derived from three different philosophical hypothesis. So the ideas (ancient of modern) are not just subjective anymore, but can be tested using experiments and theoretical/computational models.
