        <a style="color:#fe54fe;" href="https://sigmarootpi.com/weblog/data/longpost/2025-02-10-00-00">A perfect blog design or a nightmare</a>
  </h4><br>

  <p>Designing a personal blog on internet 2.0 seems a very easy task as one can choose among various existing themes. However, chosing  a template and modifying it to make it look like your perfect place on internet is a nightmare. I am playing with the design of my static website for a couple of weeks and it is very addictive. The first version was similar to my <a href="http://bactra.org/weblog">Cosma's weblog</a> but it was quite messy with a lot of clutter. So after making a fewer modifications and doing comparison with other fellow bloggers, I decided to go for something unique. Accodingly, I went for bootstrap-386 theme--the current one--which has a style of ancient DOS computers of 1986. The beautiful blue background was eye catching and able to express my nerdiness. After making some further changes I successfully--after two attempts--added my own <a href="../../../guestbook/">guestbook</a>.  </p>
<p>The current theme looks cute but the urge of making it perfect never goes away, I guess. Most of the time I dwell in between writing a blogpost or modify my blog to make it look heavenly. If I give too much time to modify, I critisize myself that I could have written a blogpost. This critism aligns well with <a href="https://jatan.space">Jatan's</a> comment in <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-jatan-mehta">People and Blogs interview</a>--hosted by <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com">Manu</a>--in which he mentioned that the looks of the blog matters a little less than the material it provides. However, other bloggers such as <a href="https://avas.space">Ava</a> seems to contradict the argument of Jatan. Ava has a beautiful website which has gone through at least a couple of major iterations. This contradiction suggest that design of your blog also depends on the audience. If you write for yourself than the design matters but if you write for others than the material it provides is important.  </p>
<p>After so much scholarly discussion, I can not promise that I wont change the design of my blog but for sure I will focus more on writing.  </p>
<p>Another interest of mine is to self-hosting my own website, which I found to be an amazing idea. Although my website seems to be running pretty fine, I still want to feel an illusion of full control by self hosting it. This illusion convinced me to invest in purchasing a Raspberry Pi 5 which is a perfect pocket size computer and I am not scared of breaking it. I plant to host my blog on Pi by running Pybloxsom on it. If it works then I do not need to convert my blog to static html pages.  </p>
<p>Despite of having such appealing dreams, setting up Pi is not an easy task, and, therefore, it is still in progress. I will talk about it some other day. But I am already using Pyblosxom and currenly running my blog--yes this one you are reading--with its help. Pybloxsom is a powerful tool written in python and inspired by its grandfather, <a href="http://www.blosxom.com">Bloxsom</a> which is just a perl script that can convert text files to html pages, and can manage to run whole blog from a single perl script.</p>

  </h4><br>

  <p>I recently came to know about a fascinating idea of making an online Garden in Indie Blogging. An online garden is a personal space on internet where the online presence of the user--or online gardener--grows with time in a well structured manner. It is similar to a bio garden but instead of prospering in terms of plants it's the online presence which evolves. Besides the general definition--which you can find here--it can be a place for me to dump my knowledge and keep track of it.  </p>
<p>Although I found the concept of online garden a few weeks ago in blogging community,  I already have it for almost 6 months now. It was <a href="http://bactra.org/notebooks">Cosma Shalizi</a> through whom I got this idea as he has enormously big data base in terms of notebooks. You can say his garden has the size of a forest. So following his idea I built the same.
Similar to Cosma, my garden is in the form of notebooks in which I write about the topics I read. For example, if I read about biological laws of evolution, I will put it in a notebook named <a href="../../../notebooks/data/LawsInBiology">biological laws</a>. With time, if I found more interesting laws I will add to it.  </p>
<p>Keeping the information organized in the notebook form is very convinient but searching a specific information is not. Oftentimes, I forget the name of the notebook in which I noted down the information previously and to find that the notebook I need to dig through the databased or simply give up if I am in hurry. So one solution to this problem, I found, is building my own Wikipedia. Regarding this solution, I read many methods to make a Wikipedia and the one I finalized is <a href="https://dokuwiki.org">dokuwiki</a>.  </p>
<p>Setting up <strong>dokuwiki</strong> was relatively easy--just download it and configure apache2 to run ".php" script. Configuring apache2 to do anything is never straight forward but I made it work. I chose a minimal template to remove the clutter and let it look simple. On top of that, I found that it support ".markdown" format and I could import/convert all my notebooks in dokuwiki format.  </p>
<p>Finally to make it accesible online, I am planning to set up self-hosting on a new toy of mine, Raspberry pi 5. However, I have doubts as well, whether it will be any better than notebooks because my notebooks looks very cute to read. Anyway, I am still working on it and I will write about it once I finish setting it up.</p>

  </h4><br>

  <p>I was recently exploring a method to compare different versions of my thesis in latex. Interestingly, there is no simple way except joining all files in one <strong>.tex</strong> file and compare it with a similar file of older version. The files can be done joined in one <strong>.tex</strong> file using a python module, flattex which can be directly installed in using Git.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>git clone git@github.com:johnjosephhorton/flatex.git<br>
cd flatex<br>
pip install --editable  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, to compare the two versions of the thesis where main.tex is the file which keep the structure of all <strong>.tex</strong> files using <strong>/input</strong> method, flatex need to be ran first</p>
<blockquote>
<p>flatex /path/to/V1/main.tex /path/to/V1/old.tex<br>
flatex /path/to/V2/main.tex /path/to/V2/new.tex</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, we can use latexdiff to compare old version (old.tex) with new version (new.tex)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>latexdiff /path/to/old.tex /path/to/new.tex &gt; /path/to/diff.tex</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Copy the graphics file related to newer version in the folder containing <em>diff.tex</em> and compile the latex file.</p>

  <p>This is a quite popular argument that a boring but essential taks of our everyday life, cleaning, is therapeutic. I very often postpone it and prefer to be indulged into more interesting stuff. Then after sometime when my mess becomes impossible to be ignored, I clean my room. It feels so refreshing like I found something very new.</p>

  <p>This is rather a small update than a blog post. Finally we have a guestbook of our own. Now you can click on the link <a href="../../../guestbook/">Guestbook</a> in top menu--if you are reading it on a computer--or in the droplist icon on your phone, and write comments.  </p>
<p>For those who are unaware of the concept of a Guestbook, it is similar to a visitor log in which you write down something like, "I was here :)". For more details please check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guestbook">Wikipedia</a>. I found visitor logs really amazing as you can mark your presence to the place you visited and show your appreciation. In the online era, it sounds less exciting but it is very similar idea. So if you are visiting my garden, please leave a nice comment. 🤗</p>
