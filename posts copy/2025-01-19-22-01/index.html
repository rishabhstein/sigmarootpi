<p>
	After getting inspired by a few bloggers whom I got the chance to know from reddit--actually subreddit of digitalminimalism--where they were mentioned on the FAQ page, I have decided that I will try to post more frequently. For that purpose, I am following the ideas of <a href="https://anniemueller.com/">Annie Mueller</a> to post regularly and open heartedly--I guess this does not include stupidity.<br><br>
<p>In addition, the short and quick thoughts will be posted on micro blogging website, <a href="https://micro.blog/sigmarootpi">micro.blog</a>, and long posts will be posted here on my own blog. Micro-blogging seems to me an alternative of <b>X</b>(formely Twitter) where anyone can see your posts. Here on micro-blog, I guess there is more privacy from random bots and people. The main advantage of this is thought tracking or note taking. So I have paid subscription now, and we will see how much we will be able to follow.</p>
