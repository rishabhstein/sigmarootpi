<p>It's not very clear what one thinks one wants, or may be it is just an illusion of abundance of choices, among which one think that he can choose a better option. But what is better choice? when the word better is defined only based on limited experiences and resulting perception. A question repeatedly comes to me, asking who am I? Many thinkers
tried to answer it including ancient hindus explaining that Aham Brahmasmi--I am Brahm, the truth, the Sat. Moreover, the idea of Brahma is just an thought based description, without any realization. So all the histories monumental thinkers just wasted their time?</p>
<p>It may be possible!! but on the contrary these thinkers made the world what we see it today. Democritus argued the world is made of Atoms, a fundamental unit of nature, of which we all are made of. When one dies these atoms merely transforms from one combination to another. Kanada (read as ka+naa+da), an ancient Hindu sage, believed in a similar concept however his Atoms has properties due to which we observe the differences in material properties.</p>
<p>These observations, despite of being thousands of years old still holds upto certain accuracy with one major difference--we have not only a general idea of these laws but also a concrete mathematical description. Accordingly, the intuition of earth having an attraction force towards an object--Aristotle and Aryabhatt hypothesis?--was validated and formulated by Newton in his inverse-sqaure law. Moreover, in a book The character of Physical Laws, the famous physicist Richard P. Feynman argues that the inverse square law can be derived from three different philosophical hypothesis. So the ideas (ancient of modern) are not just subjective anymore, but can be tested using experiments and theoretical/computational models.</p>
