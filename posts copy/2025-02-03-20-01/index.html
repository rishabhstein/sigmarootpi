<p>When I read that line, I thought about the ugliness of the internet in terms of exploiting social networking algorithms. I used to be a technology geek who was always updated with new gadgets, internet tools, and God-forbidden social networks. Luckily, I realized a couple of years ago that this was not what I had signed up for, and I quit all of them for good. BREAK
Since then, life has never been better. I am exploring and learning so many new things about myself and the world, which would be impossible if I wasted my time on micro-blogging platforms.</p>
<p>Sadly, the majority of people around me, including my own family members, are stuck in this trap. Even when they notice about their screen time (not for the same <a href="https://blog.avas.space/screentime/">reasons</a> Ava mentioned), it is hard for them to quit because these algorithms manipulate people on deeper psychological levels.</p>
<p>It is a sad reality that the whole society is negatively affected by a few evil companies, and that's not my internet.</p>
