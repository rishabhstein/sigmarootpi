<p>For the past couple of days, I have been working--or trying to distract myself from professional work--tirelessly on the design of my blog as well as of my own Wikipedia. I was playing around with the current CSS file of the blog, which was taken from Pyblosxom themes. These templates were often too complex to understand for a beginner and were filled with styles of webpage elements that I was not going to use. Today I decided to make a fresh CSS file and marvelously in less than 50 lines I was able to design most of the elements of my blog. I am really proud of it.<br>

In addition to my blog, I also modified my encyclopedia, which was not a complicated task. However, bringing it online was not trivial, especially when Apache wasn't happy with the modification due to permission issues and constantly showing 404 errors for several hours. But, on the bright side, this trial-and-error method and resulting lessons with Apache are saved on my Wikipedia.</p>
