<p>This is a high time for my PhD thesis as I am planning to submit it by the end of this month. Although the writing was done almost six months ago, the corrections are still going on. Even the minor changes can sometimes take several hours to implement because they break the consistency of a hundred-page document. Indeed, my thesis is now around one hundred and seven pages long, which was corrected multiple times, and yet the mistakes are inevitable.</p>
<p>I have complained multiple times about my thesis. So here I wanted to talk about relaxing time. After working 7-8 hours straight on my thesis last Saturday, I was completely down, frustrated, and irritated. I did not speak for almost three hours while going on a walk with my wife because I did not want to say anything bitter or rude.</p>
<p>During the walk, we took a short break and sat next to a pond where there were a lot of ducks and a pair of <em>Swan</em>. My wife was fascinated by the long neck of Swan as this might be her first time seeing that bird so closely, outside the zoo. I, on the other hand, was more interested in ducks. I was stalking two ducks who were from different species but they were swimming together--almost like they were friends. When a third duck appeared, they chased it away.</p>
<p>I feel so funny right now (almost giggling) while telling you all about my <em>duck stalking adventure</em>. However, at that time, I was trying to digest what was happening. I was wondering, why these guys are together. Based on my knowledge of species evolution, this is a weird incident. There were other birds as well, mostly alone, except <em>Swan</em>--they are known to be a lifetime couple--but why these two birds from two different species are together?</p>
<p>I didn't make any revolutionary discovery that day but watching them calmed me down, which followed my first words after that long silence. I whispered in my wife's ear, look at those two birdy friends :P. That's the beauty of nature.</p>
