<p>I often delves into consuming vs creating dilemma. From consuming, I do not mean social media as I am out of that vicious circle. What I refer to here is reading online articles or watching shows/movies. From creating I mean  writing a blog post, do some programming (not by using ChatGPT), editing photos, or playing instruments.</p>
<p>Although, it is hard to define consumption and creation—there could be subjective nuance here for individuals, I differentiate them based on my mind’s reaction. For instance if an activity improves focus and calms down my mind that is usually an indication of creative activity. On the other hand, if an activity increases chaos in mind—-short attention spans, too much jumps between thoughts—-it leads to a lack of satisfaction and irritation, which indicates consumption. In simpler terms, creative activity brings satisfaction and peace while consuming activity gives headaches if done too much.</p>
<p>Interestingly, programming is a creative activity but only if it is done yourself in a familiar language. However, nowadays, using AI, programming can be done in completely unfamiliar languages. That’s a catch, right there. <strong>If an AI tool create a program and you are going to use it, this shift it from being a creative activity to a consuming activity.</strong> I am speaking from my experiences because after the goal (working program) is achieved I usually end up with irritation.</p>
<p>Among many changes AI is bringing to life, this is just one. Our whole understanding of the world is challenged—-may be for good—-and we need to modify it. But is it a feasible task? considering millions of years of knowledge. What do you think?</p>
