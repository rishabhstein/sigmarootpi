<p>Today was my PhD exam (not defence) which I needed to pass to complete the requirement of obtaining a doctoral degree in Poland. This exam is the last--but most crucial--hurdle for a PhD candidate to get the doctorate, so you can guess how stressful it was for me while preparing for it. I was studying (almost :p) daily in the morning, around 4-5 hours, for a whole month while working on research projects during office hours.</p>
<p>The format of the exam was to discuss three specific questions out of three topics--one from each--which were selected from a list of five topics. These topics were given a month ago by a doctoral committee of eight professors. One question was related to my PhD thesis, which focuses on <em>porous medium flows</em>, while the other two were slightly off: one was about <em>classical kinetic theory: Boltzmann equation</em>, and another was <em>micro-macroscopic diffusion</em>.</p>
<p>All of these are fantastic topics, so I really enjoyed studying them, but I think I was overprepared. Although the questions were not that hard, my discussion was very chaotic--jumping from one point to another without properly describing the first point. This was the result of a fear of making mistakes because I had too much in my head, and I am not an expert in most of these topics.</p>
<p>Regardless, the committee was satisfied with my work but sarcastically complained about my laziness in discussing details. I, on the other hand, was not confident in my knowledge, so I was talking in simplified terms and expecting that they would ask detailed questions. In the end, I was given a good grade with a green light for my PhD defence. I was happy yeyyyyyy.</p>
<p>It was a demanding journey where hard work, combined with the support of my supervisor and my family, and luck paid off in the end. The calm and relief I feel now are beyond words.</p>
