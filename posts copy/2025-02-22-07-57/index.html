<p>I run my blog by self-hosting it but I frequently visit <strong>Bearblog</strong> discover section to hunt for beautiful posts written by beautiful people. Many time, I thought about moving my blog to Bear untill a recent situation. After <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/">Manu</a> posted his thoughts related to some post arguing readership over uniqueness (I guess you know what I am talking about), I decided to dig in and find the author. It turn out to be one of the bear-blogger (former now) who posted multiple times intriguing stuff. And yet, his one critical idea (or a mistake?) lead to a situation in which he quitted from Bearblog :(. When I read the reasoning on his new webpage, I spotted a very interesting pattern which is similar what I've observed on many social media groups where one single comment results a flood of criticism. He mentioned that how people did not understand the point, and critisized him not only by reposting but also on his email.</p>
<p>In my view reposting is an acceptable way to show disagreement but when someone receive several emails of criticism, it can be very hard. Most of us are so tired due to work/studies that getting critisized on your beloved blog is the last thing you want. Yet this can happen.</p>
<p>This made me think that having a blogging community is a curse as well as a boon. On one side I am excited about sharing my thoughts, but on other side I am scared about sharing them. So this explains my main dilemma of moving my blog from self-hosting to Bear.</p>
<p>So for now, I will try to continue posting on my blog with filtered—and occasional—cross posting here. However, I will regularly return to read your beautiful blogs :)</p>
