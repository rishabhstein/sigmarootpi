<p>Last few days I am running around in my current city to get some official documents prepared and legitimised so that I can use them for job purposes in another EU country. Now in the beginning of my document-collecting-adventure I thought it should be a smooth process as EU is a union of countries so one document should be accepted in all EU countries. However, with time, I realized that that is not the case, especially if you are not from EU.</p>
<p>For instance, in Poland where I currenty lives, a no criminal record certificate (NCR) can be obtained by anyone who resides in Poland, and it is accepted in whole EU territory. The only condition is that the language of the document should be English or the language of the state in which it needs to be submitted. However the catch here is that the multi-language version is given to only Polish nationals, and not to non-Polish people. For non-Polish person it will only be in Polish. As a result its unacceptable in another EU state. To make it valid in EU first I need to validate it according to Hague convention (in simple terms apostile it) following which I need to translate it and then I need to validate the translation by doing a second apostile.</p>
<p>Its a tricky business and it needs to be done so there is no escape, and I am ok with it. You can argue about importance of bureaucracy and I get it. I respect the rules of my territory and usually try to adjust for small inconveniences. However what upsets me is the corruption this beaurocracy brings. Lets again take an example of NCR. Now to follow the procedure of dual apostile and translation, I need to go to Ministery of Foreign affairs (MFA) for which I need to book an appointment. But just to book a time-slot is not trivial. The daily released slots vanish so fast that in few moments whole day slots are gone. On the other hand, in market there are private companies who claim to already have these slots. I WONDER HOW!!!!. Now if someone want to take their service the amount of money these companies ask could be 4-5 times higher. This is outrageous.</p>
<p>I feel the immigrants are the perfect target for these kind of scams because they will not speak against due to several reasons including language barrier and the fear of being detained. Also, native will never go there and deal with these issues. So no one gonna complain and politicians wont loose any vote. A perfect place for corruption to brood.</p>
<p>Now, not to drag this post further, I only want things to be transparent and smoother, as well as pocket friendly. No matter how many documents they want, I am ready to provide but please save me from cheater and fraud companies. My time and money comes at the expense of public money, and I do not want to feel guilty about it. Neither I want to feel cheated in doing same formalities which native are doing so easily.</p>
<p>So I wonder whether there is a way to resolve this problem or the need of beaurocracy is the only answer we have.</p>
