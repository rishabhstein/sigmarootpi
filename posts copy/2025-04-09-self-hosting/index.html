<p>Recently I became very interested in self-hosting popular cloud services such as drive, notes, media-servers (like netflix), and even a google like search engine. This fascination with self-hosting is not new to me as this very blog is self-hosted on a RaspberryPi. You can check my blog setup on <a href="/2025/02/21/colophon/">colophon</a> page. However, hearing so much criticism of <em>Google</em> like companies--selling data and targeted advertisments--from my fellow <em>Indie</em> bloggers motivated me further to try self-hosting. Since I have all the ingredients, it was a matter of time before I tried self-hosting.</p>
<p>For the past couple of weeks, I have been experimenting with several of these services including <a href="https://nextcloud.com">NextCloud</a> as a replacement of <em>Gdrive</em>, <a href="https://bpatrik.github.io/pigallery2/">pigallery2</a> for <em>google-photos</em>, <a href="https://github.com/pawelmalak/snippet-box">Snippet-box</a> as a technical note taking app, and <a href="https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search">Whoogle</a> as a replacement of advertisement master, <em>Google</em>. I have also set up my own self-hosted adblocker, <a href="https://pi-hole.net">Pi-hole</a>, that has reduced the amount of ads I see on other websites. At this point, I am very happy with this setup and I plan to experiment further by setting up a media server so that I can watch my favorite shows and listen to ad-free music from my own system.</p>

<p>I am accessing these services using a <a href="https://www.wireguard.com">WireGuard</a> VPN which allows me to connect to my home wifi from anywhere in the world without exposing any <em>ports</em> and local <em>IP</em>. That means no one else can sneak into my network and use these services. However my blog and <em>Whoogle</em> are exposed to outside network and people can use them but I tried to keep them hidden behind a <em>Cloudflare</em> tunnel.</p>
<p>This whole setup might sound very exciting but I would like to remind you that it is not free from vulnerabilities. It's a bit sad to learn that internet is full of data-thieves and hackers--in the form of bots and crawlers made by humans--which will not miss a single chance to hack your system. So <strong>I would not encourage anyone to try self-hosting without any guidance.</strong> I am also not an expert in network systems but I am following the advices of experts on internet as well as from real life.</p>
