<p>Hello. I have mentioned earlier in a previous <a href="/posts/2025-05-13-moving-to-11ty/">post</a> that I am working on moving my blog from <a href="">Aurora</a> to <a href="">11ty</a>. Today I moved most of my blog to <em>11ty</em> so if you are reading this post in a browser, you are seeing the version powered by <em>11ty</em>.</p>
<p>Now one of the tricky part is keeping the <strong>RSS</strong> feed working and untouched so that subscribers, if there is any, won't see any weird behavior. The worst case scenario is the broken <em>RSS</em> feed. The reason for this is Aurora does not have any native <em>RSS</em> generator and depends on an online service such as <strong>Granary</strong> to convert HTML page to RSS feed. 11ty, on the other hand, is a popular blogging engine and does support native <em>RSS</em> generation. So good news is &quot;now this blog has its own RSS feed&quot;.</p>
<p>So I am writing to you all my dear subscribers that</p>
<p><strong>The RSS FEED URL is changed now. So please update it</strong></p>
<p>from</p>
<p><a href="">https://granary/WHATEVER/IT/WAS/EARLIER</a></p>
<p>to</p>
<p><a href="https://sigmarootpi.com/feed.xml">https://sigmarootpi/feed.xml</a></p>
<p>I will also add it as a warning in future posts at least in 5 upcoming posts.</p>
