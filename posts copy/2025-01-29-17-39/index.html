<p>This is rather a small update than a blog post. Finally we have a guestbook of our own. Now you can click on the link <a href="../../../guestbook/">Guestbook</a> in top menu--if you are reading it on a computer--or in the droplist icon on your phone, and write comments.</p>
<p>For those who are unaware of the concept of a Guestbook, it is similar to a visitor log in which you write down something like, &quot;I was here :)&quot;. For more details please check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guestbook">Wikipedia</a>. I found visitor logs really amazing as you can mark your presence to the place you visited and show your appreciation. In the online era, it sounds less exciting but it is very similar idea. So if you are visiting my garden, please leave a nice comment. ðŸ¤—</p>
