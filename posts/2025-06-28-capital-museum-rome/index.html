            <p>A few weeks ago I was in Rome with my wife and it was an exhausting trip, with me having a mix of emotions. As any touristy city, there were a lot of street sellers who were approaching people to sell things, food items, and water. It was irritating but I was repeatedly reminding myself that I am also in a city of Stoics where once <strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong> and <strong>Seneca</strong> has walked through. So I kept my calm and walked around the city as a they would have done. We visited many places in <em>Rome</em> including the famous <strong>Colosseum</strong> and its adjacent archaeological sites, ‚ÄúRoma Forum‚Äù, as well as a few nearby museums. I need a separate post to express myself for each visit so here I will limit myself to the visit of Capital museum aka ‚ÄúMusei Capitoline‚Äù.</p>
<p>The reason of posting first about this particular museum is because of my fascination for Stoicism. I have mentioned about it <a href="/posts/2025-06-23-wisdom-from-roman-empire">earlier</a> in my blog.</p>
<p>This museum is situated in the heart of Rome at hilltop square (Piazza del Campidoglio). It contains many precious gems of Roman empire such as the remains of ancient Roman temples, pottery, graffiti, and many historical statues such as She-wolf, Socrates and Marcus Aurelius. Entering in this museum made me feel like I was entering in real Roman kingdom. Although there was a lot to see there, I focused only looking for Stoics. This was partly because of a lack of history knowledge and partly because of my tiredness as we were walking almost 15-20km everyday. However, in the museum I found only one stoic, Marcus Aurelius. It was still an amazing feeling to be there, to stand right next to his statue and feel its power. I haven't taken many photos from that museum but wherever I saw Marcus, I asked my wife to take my photo with him. Every encounter with him was an emotional one as if a student were meeting his Guru. However, the meeting was taking place around 2000 years later of the existense of a guru and his disciple‚Äôs time.</p>
<p>I also came across Commodus‚Äî-Marcus‚Äôs only son-‚Äîwho was posing in Hercules dress. What a pompous charlatan!!. I laughed and cursed him for his stupidity that led him to his assassination. Seeing him also reminded me his portrayal in Gladiator movie‚Äî-I was watching it during this trip‚Äî-where he killed Marcus Aurelius. Although movie was pure fiction, and historians believe that Marcus died of natural causes, reading about Stoics and Marcus‚Äôs only book ‚ÄúMeditations‚Äù made me feel the plausibility of the hypothesis proposed in the movie. After all Commodus was a fool and immoral man contrary to his father who was famous for his wisdom.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am not here to challenge historians and I might be a emotional fool as well. But seeing Commodus as a successor of Marcus did not feel right, especially when Marcus--and four kings before him--was not born king but selected and trained by previous king Antoninus. Ruminating this I finished my visit and went home.</p>
