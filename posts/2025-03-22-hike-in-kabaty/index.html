<div class="container-narrow">

            <p>I have mentioned earlier in a <a href="./2025-02-23-16-48.html">post</a> about the beauty of Warsaw spring, and today we--me, my wifey, and my buddy Micha≈Ç--went to explore a forest known as <em>Kabaty</em>, which is a natural reserve at the vicinity of <strong>Southern Warsaw</strong>. We have been planning since yesterday to go to <em>Kabaty</em> with a group. But that group never replied to Micha≈Ç on messenger--it could be because he asked them a bit late. So this morning, we decided to go on our own. First, Micha≈Ç came to our place to pick us up in his car, and then we went together to the forest.</p>
<p>The experience in nature was--and always is--beyond words. We were surrounded by so many trees (mostly without leaves), among which a few have fallen, completely de-rooted. We immediately started walking on them. It was a lot of fun to do <strong>log-crossing</strong>. Sometimes, I was feeling scared to fall down, but most of the time, it wasn't that deep below--maybe a meter only. We crossed as many log bridges as possible. We also spotted a lot of hard mushrooms--like a rock--on the trunk of these trees.</p>
<p>Among these trees, there were also fallen leaves, covering the whole ground. While walking through this scenery, we were crushing these leaves with each step, which was making sounds 'Swshhh‚Ä¶ Mfffshh‚Ä¶'. My wife was in a forest for the first time, so she was following us in our adventures, but with a bit of precaution. She seems to be enjoying her time in nature, listening to birds singing and trying to spot the birds. We were also reading the signs about the variety of wild animals that live in this forest.</p>
<p>So we had a blasting Saturday :). Not like a party blast but a natural blast.</p>

            <p>&quot;The truth is often painful and disturbing, and if we try to make it more comforting and flattering, it will no longer be the truth.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Truth, then, isn‚Äôt a one-to-one representation of reality. Rather, truth is something that brings our attention to certain aspects of reality while inevitably ignoring other...
