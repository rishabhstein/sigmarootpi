            <blockquote><a href="https://people.well.com/user/jonl/viridiandesign/notes/1-25/Note%2000002.txt">Attention conservation notice:</a> New fascination of a new blogger.</blockquote>
<p>I recently came to know about a fascinating idea of making an online Garden in Indie Blogging. An online garden is a personal space on the internet where the online presence of the user--or online gardener--grows with time in a well-structured manner. It is similar to a bio garden but instead of prospering in terms of plants, it's the online presence that evolves. Besides the general definition--which you can find here--it can be a place for me to dump my knowledge and keep track of it.</p>
<p>Although I found the concept of an online garden a few weeks ago in the blogging community,  I already have had it for almost 6 months now. It was <a href="http://bactra.org/notebooks">Cosma Shalizi</a> through whom I got this idea as he has an enormously big database in terms of notebooks. You can say his garden is the size of a forest. So following his idea I built the same. Similar to Cosma, my garden is in the form of notebooks in which I write about the topics I read. For example, if I read about the biological laws of evolution, I will put it in a notebook named <a href="../../../notebooks/data/LawsInBiology">biological laws</a>. With time, if I find more interesting laws I will add to it.</p>
<p>Keeping the information organized in the notebook form is very convenient but searching a specific information is not. Oftentimes, I forget the name of the notebook in which I noted down the information previously and to find the notebook I need to dig through the database or simply give up if I am in a hurry. So one solution to this problem, I found, is building my own Wikipedia. Regarding this solution, I read many methods to make a Wikipedia and the one I finalized is <a href="https://dokuwiki.org">Dokuwiki</a>.</p>
<p>Setting up <strong>Dokuwiki</strong> was relatively easy--just download it and configure apache2 to run the &quot;.php&quot; script. Configuring apache2 to do anything is never straight forward but I made it work. I chose a minimal template to remove the clutter and let it look simple. On top of that, I found that it supports the &quot;.markdown&quot; format and I could import/convert all my notebooks in DokuWiki format.</p>
<p>Finally, to make it accessible online, I am planning to set up self-hosting on a new toy of mine, Raspberry Pi 5. However, I have doubts as well, whether it will be any better than notebooks because my notebooks look very cute to read. Anyway, I am still working on it and I will write about it once I finish setting it up.</p>

            <p>&quot;I began to reflect how we are attended by an appaling forgetfulness of our weaknesses, even the physical ones which are continually bringing themselves to our notice, and much more so with those that are not only more serious but correspondingly less apparent.&quot;</p> ...

            <p>&quot;The truth is often painful and disturbing, and if we try to make it more comforting and flattering, it will no longer be the truth.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Truth, then, isn‚Äôt a one-to-one representation of reality.
