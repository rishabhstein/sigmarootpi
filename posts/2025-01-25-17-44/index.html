<h1>What should I write about?</h1>

            <blockquote><a href="https://people.well.com/user/jonl/viridiandesign/notes/1-25/Note%2000002.txt">Attention conservation notice:</a> A beginner of Indie blogging is confused about blogging.</blockquote>
<p>
<p>Recently, I got exposure to <a href="https://indieweb.org/">Indie blogging</a>, which is a very nice way of socializing on the internet. Contrary to the modern way of posting on social media and expecting strangers--(un)wanted--to like or comment on it, this type of online interaction on a blog with people of similar interests seems like pure bliss.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>The key highlight, in my opinion, of this method is that one has a chance to express himself in an articulated manner, and once you publish it, the readers who find time to read it are dedicated enough to give constructive feedback. Following this train of thoughts, I started exploring the blogs of few nice people on internet--<a href = "https://manuelmoreale.com/">Manu</a>, <a href = "https://anniemueller.com/">Annie</a>, <a href = "https://writing.desipundit.com/">Pratik</a> and <a href = "https://blog.avas.space/">Ava</a>--which convinced me to give it a try. I also want to point out that I wrote a few entries on my blog a couple of years ago, but I never wrote regularly. Also, I did not know that I could connect with people in this way.<br><br></p>
<p>After writing a few entries, I feel a little confused about deciding what to write. Many times, I have an explosion of new ideas but if I let them go, then at the time of writing, I feel blank. Interestingly, <a href="https://btxx.org/">Brad</a> already mentioned it--along with some suggestions--in his <a href="https://btxx.org/posts/dump/">blogpost.</a> So today, I decided to write about that dilemma because I want to find a solution to it.<br><br></p>
<p>One method is to write down the ideas in my diary so that I can recall them whenever I want to write. Although this seems a reasonable approach, its effectiveness is unclear. Bloggers often write, in detail, about topics they feel are important and interesting and treat the blog as a place to dump their thoughts, feelings, and opinions. Thus, the idea of recalling the topics later does not work because, at the time of writing, I might be thinking about a completely different topic than the ones I noted down earlier.<br><br></p>
<p>I still have no idea how to proceed except for the hope that I will manage. Many times in my life, I have seen that theory and practice are very different things. So maybe playing with the idea of &quot;noting down in a diary&quot; might prove to be a good solution.<br><br></p>
<p>I will update you later about the experience.</p>
</p>

-------------------------
<h3>Upate: 12-02-2025</h3>
The last paragraph, as I suspected, is indeed useless. I can clearly see now that writing about the idea when it is in my mind is the best time to do it because as soon as I loose the feelings for the topic, I will procrastinate and abandon the topic.

            <p>&quot;I began to reflect how we are attended by an appaling forgetfulness of our weaknesses, even the physical ones which are continually bringing themselves to our notice, and much more so with those that are not only more serious but correspondingly less apparent.&quot;</p> ...

            <p>&quot;The truth is often painful and disturbing, and if we try to make it more comforting and flattering, it will no longer be the truth.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Truth, then, isn‚Äôt a one-to-one representation of reality. Rather, truth is something that brings our attention to certain aspects of reality while inevitably ignoring other...
