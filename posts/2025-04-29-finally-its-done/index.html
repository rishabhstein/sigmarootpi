<h1>Finally its done (PhD thesis)</h1>

<div class="container-narrow">

            <p>For the past couple of weeks, I‚Äôve been thinking about writing a post, but due to my busy schedule with my PhD exam (not yet the defense), I couldn‚Äôt get to it. A lot has happened this month, including the most important event--submission of my PhD thesis (yes, it‚Äôs done! :D).</p>
<p>I wanted to write a separate post about it since I‚Äôve ranted a lot in the past about the struggle with the final step of the thesis (review and corrections) when I was almost at the verge of breaking down. So, I thought this achievement deserved a proper post, but unfortunately, I was feeling too down mentally to talk about it. In the meantime, I posted about other things but not about the PhD submission.</p>
<p>Anyway, I submitted my thesis on April 1st-‚Äîfooling myself, LOL‚Äî-after working around 21 hours straight without any break. At the last moment, my vision became blurry, but somehow, I managed to finish it. Later, I became worried about having made some mistakes in the text, and whenever I opened my thesis, I spotted new mistakes. My wife and friends advised me not to do this, but it was hard to ignore as everything was still so fresh in my head.</p>
<p>After submission, I went to a short (three-day) vacation with my wife to a beautiful place, <a href="https://g.co/kgs/AGp5pS6">Hel</a>, in the north of <strong>Poland</strong>. The reason for the &quot;short&quot; vacation was my insecurity about leaving unfinished projects behind, as well as my finances. Although my friends encouraged me to take a longer vacation, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it. Submitting my thesis also meant the end of my PhD studentship‚Äîand the scholarship‚Äîat my university. Unfortunately, my project salary also ran out around the same time. So, for now, I‚Äôm surviving on my savings.</p>
<p>Regardless, we enjoyed three nice days in nature near the roaring sea. The sound of the sea really calmed my mind. Both my wife and I were happy there. We were regularly going for long walks or were just staying at the beach, watching the seagulls. :)</p>
<p>In the following weeks, I read on Reddit about other people‚Äôs experiences with writing and found that mistakes are inevitable. Most people who‚Äôve ever written anything have gone through similar feelings. So after this, I made peace with myself and assumed that mistakes are there, and it‚Äôs better to ignore them, at least for now. However, now I‚Äôm thinking of making an <strong>Errata</strong> page for scorrections in the future.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs another big update, which I won‚Äôt reveal just yet, but it‚Äôs coming soon after my PhD exam.</p>

            <p>&quot;The truth is often painful and disturbing, and if we try to make it more comforting and flattering, it will no longer be the truth.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Truth, then, isn‚Äôt a one-to-one representation of reality.
