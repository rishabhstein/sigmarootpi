<div class="container-narrow">

            <p>You might have noticed that I haven‚Äôt posted here for a while. The reason for my short absence was not my ignorance as I was writing the posts in my phone‚Äîkeeping the records of very important events of my life. It was because of the frequency of these events and limited time for contemplation, leaving me ruminating whether I will do proper justifications to these posts.</p>
<p>Among those events, two most important ones are my PhD defence and my recent visit to Rome. Although PhD defence was a life changing event, I will not discuss it here as I talked about this topic‚Äîmostly my struggles in this journey‚Äîmany times <a href="https://sigmarootpi.com/tags/phd/">*</a>. Also, I have a full post, written, about my trip to Rome in draft folder, waiting to be posted. So I will not either go into details of the trip.</p>
<p>What I want to do here is to give an update about these changes and how do I feel about them. The defence was on last Tuesday, following the trip, which was two weeks ago. After the trip I was happy and relaxed. I had a book,   <em>Letter of a Stoic</em> by <em>Seneca</em> from the trip as a souvenir. This is a beautiful memory from the Capitol Museum, where they have the remains of ancient Rome. I was enjoying reading it (yes I like Stoicism). But then later, the following week, that peace was destroyed when I needed to work very hard on the reviewers‚Äô comments. The criticism again took toll on my mind and I lost all the positive energy gained from trip.</p>
<p>Now after the defence, I am trying to recover from the damage done to my mind by stress. It‚Äôs a bit relieving that finally my PhD is finished. I am still reading that book, recalling the lessons from Stoicism. Also, I am planning to get back to the track, focusing on health, doing regular workouts, practicing music, editing photos from previous trips. I have two pending reviews of the books I have read last month. So I will keep you updated.</p>

            <p>&quot;I began to reflect how we are attended by an appaling forgetfulness of our weaknesses, even the physical ones which are continually bringing themselves to our notice, and much more so with those that are not only more serious but correspondingly less apparent.&quot;</p> ...

            <p>&quot;The truth is often painful and disturbing, and if we try to make it more comforting and flattering, it will no longer be the truth.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Truth, then, isn‚Äôt a one-to-one representation of reality. Rather, truth is something that brings our attention to certain aspects of reality while inevitably ignoring other...
