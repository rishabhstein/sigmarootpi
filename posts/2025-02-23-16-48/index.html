<div class="container-narrow">

            <p>Today was a really nice springy day with 6-7 deg celsius temperature that might not look a lot but in here where I lives, it is an improvement over the past 4 months of cold weather. I went for a small hike (around 8km) with my friend who came back from Columbia after a couple of months. We were discussing so many things including politics, physical activity, and travelling‚Äîwe were basically letting out all the crap that was accumulating inside us from many months. For a long time, I was craving for this.</p>
<p>In the woods, there were several marvellous things to see including trees that were turning green with shedded red leaves on the ground, reminding that old is giving a way to new. The ground which was covered partially with leaves and partially with the remains of the snow that stubbornly survived by hiding under the shadow of rocks, bushes and trees. Nearby, a woodpecker was making sound, &quot;...trrrrrrrrrr...trrrrrrrrr...&quot;, probably making a new home for the coming summer. And among all these wonders, we were walking, talking and absorbing as much nature as we can.</p>
<p>In those moments, one of the nicest thing we discussed was &quot;how going for a run in these forest is an spiritual experience&quot;. Although, I am currently on a break from running for almost 4 months now due to cold weather, I am a huge fan of it and do running at least from a couple of years. I tried running at crazy hours‚Äîfor instance morning 3AM and evening 10PM‚Äîat very different terrain and locale including my current city, Warsaw (Poland). I practiced running in the beautiful capital of <em>Finland, Helsinki</em>, a small city of <em>Norway, Gielo</em>, and in a small village of <em>Polish swiƒôtokrzyskie mountain</em> region known as <em>Chƒôciny</em>. In all these years of experimenting with running what I learnt is: running in nature not only clears my head and helps me to let out all the stress, but also let me connect to nature, and to my mind-body.</p>
<p>I might sound like an experienced runner, however, this was not always the case. From the childhood, I was more fond of mental stimulation than physical. In other words, I was a lazy boy who used to justify his lazyness by throwing scientific arguments and completely ignoring sports. This lasted for sometime untill the mental stimulation became mental burden‚Äîthanks to the lonelyness due to moving out to another country, which worsened due to overusage of social media. The whole story of this transition might be a topic of another day but now, I can not wait to restart running after this long and miserable time.</p>
<p>Oh wait, you have put so much effort to read it all, I should at least show you some pictures of my day including the surprise I got from my beloved wife :D.</p>

            <p>&quot;The truth is often painful and disturbing, and if we try to make it more comforting and flattering, it will no longer be the truth.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Truth, then, isn‚Äôt a one-to-one representation of reality. Rather, truth is something that brings our attention to certain aspects of reality while inevitably ignoring other...
