Welcome to my corner of the web. This website is created with an intention of keeping a record of useful things for my everyday&mdash;professional and personal&mdash;life. Most of the data in these webpages is created by me or otherwise taken from other sources such as books, webpages, and from discussions with some amazing peers, friends and family. In the later case, I tried to give proper citations. The majority of these pages are graphicless, not that I am against of graphics as you can check a depiction of <a href="https://sigmarootpi.com/cargese.png"><u>me</u></a></li> or my amateur <a href="https://flic.kr/ps/44B85e"><u>photography</u></a>, but I found it to be less distracting.
