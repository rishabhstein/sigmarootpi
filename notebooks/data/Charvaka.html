<p align="justify">I came to know about this philosophy from a youtube documentary <a href="https://youtu.be/ymoKnBGSFGM?si=UNdTqlHx7fIIvDrw">Bharat Ek Khoj</a> which is based on a book <b>The Discovery of India</b>. It is described as a <a href="Nastika.html">Nastika</a> philosophy which rejects superstition and rituals, and believes in reasoning and what senses can perceive. Contrary to the other philosophies rejecting pleasure, this philosophy argue that the rejection of pleasure out of fear of pain is foolish, as stated in some old book from wikipedia.</p>

<center>
    The enjoyment of heaven lies in eating delicious food, 
<br>keeping company of young women, 
<br>using fine clothes, perfumes, garlands, sandal paste... 
<br>while moksha is death which is cessation of life-breath... 
<br>the wise therefore ought not to take pains on account of moksha.

<br>
<br>A fool wears himself out by penances and fasts. 
<br>Chastity and other such ordinances are laid down by clever weaklings.

<p>One key beauty of this philosopy is the explanation of supernatural phenomenon which emerges from random natural processes, similar to pattern forming processes in nature. It is explained in this quote:

<center>
    The fire is hot, the water cold, 
<br>refreshing cool the breeze of morn;
<br>By whom came this variety ? 
<br>from their own nature was it born.
