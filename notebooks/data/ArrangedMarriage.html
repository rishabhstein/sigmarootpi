	It is a complicated topic whose meaning, despite having a general description given on Wikipedia or on other media platforms, differs from society to society. In <b>Polish society</b> (maybe European society as well?) it is referred to when someone arranges a partner for you. This is an outdated system and is a dismay in public opinion. Conversely, in India, it seems to differ a lot not only in the philosophical sense where 8 types of marriages are defined in <b>Atharva Veda</b> and <b>Manusmiriti</b>, but in practice as well where parents insist to find partners for their children regardless of their children's willingness. In Indian arranged marriages, parents and family seem to play a key role contrary to Western love marriages where only the couple is important. So in a conclusive sense, one can say that <q>an Indian arranged marriage is a marriage of parents and family without much focus on the couple.</q>

	The 8 types of marriages—top 4 are accepted and bottom 4 are forbidden—are following:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Brahma Vivaha:</b> a similar tradition to modern Indian arranged marriage, in which a well-educated (in Vedas) groom's parents seek a suitable girl.</li>
		<li><b>Daiva Vivaha:</b> A bride is donated to the priest as a part of religious sacrifice.</li>
		<li><b>Arsha Vivaha:</b> It includes donation (or modern dowry?) in exchange for a bride. </li>
		<li><b>Prajapatya Vivaha:</b> It is similar to <b>Brahma Vivaha</b> but in this case the bride's parents seek a suitable guy, making it inferior to <b>Brahma Vivaha</b>.</li>
		<li><b>Gandharva Vivaha:</b> Very similar to modern-day love marriages in which lust or sexual attraction is the reason for the marriage.</li>
		<li><b>Asura Vivaha:</b> A bridegroom pays a price to get the bride. It is still in practice but only in rural areas. I have heard of 2 cases in my locality.</li>
		<li><b>Raksasha Vivaha:</b> This is a forced or kidnapped marriage. It is interesting to know that in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_society_and_culture">Romanian society</a> it is still popular. </li>
		<li><b>Paisacha Vivaha:</b> It is the most sinful act, even mentioned in <b>Manusmriti</b>, in which a woman who is asleep, intoxicated, or mentally challenged, is raped and therefore,s to preserve the honour of woman it is regarded as a marriage.</li>
	</ul>
