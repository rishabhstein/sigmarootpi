	He was a rebel in the world of philosophy who, despite of his religious background, was a strong critics of religion, christianity in particular. Accordingly, he was a critic of <a href="Romanticism.html">Romanticsm</a> and <a href="Hegel.html">Hegelianism</a> philosophy&mdash;popular at that time&mdash;which focuses on objective truth.
	<br><br>

	Kierkegaard advocated that in an individual's life objective truth is irrelevant, and what matter's (surprise!!) is the subjective truth. For instance, a dying man would not care if <i>Pi's</i> value is 3.1415.. or 22/7 or both. He categorised life in three stages: asthetic (Hedonist), ethical, and religious. Aesthetic are more or less <a href="Charvaka.html">Charvaka</a>. They enjoy materialism and sensual pleasure. However at certain moment in their life they feel emptyness which is kind of existential crisis&mdash;makes you think something is wrong.<br>
	This brings you to the second stage, ethical form, in which one start following morals. It is certainly the hardest and people mostly relapsed to asthetic stage.<br>
	Those who survive, move to religious stage with a complete surrender to the God.

	<br><br>Conclusively, we dwell in the realm of Kierkegaard.
