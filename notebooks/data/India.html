	It is rather a complicated topic as majority of the history of common knowledge was documented and reported from post-colonial era. Many argue about this history including Dharampal who wrote a book named, <i>The Beautiful Tree</i>, and claimed the falsification of data about Indian history reported by British and other European historians. 

	However, for me the most fascinating is the history of pre-colonial era. William Dalrymple in his recent book pointed a very intriguing idea of golden road which was a sea route actually. It existed even before <i>the famous silk road</i>, and vanished due to fall of Roman empire as well as the rise of Mongol empire.
