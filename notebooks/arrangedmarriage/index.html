<h1>Arranged Marriage</h1>

            <p>Arranged Marriage</p>
<p>It is a complicated topic whose meaning, despite having a general
description given on Wikipedia or on other media platforms, differs from
society to society. In <strong>Polish society</strong> (maybe European society as
well?) it is referred to when someone arranges a partner for you. This
is an outdated system and is a dismay in public opinion. Conversely, in
India, it seems to differ a lot not only in the philosophical sense
where 8 types of marriages are defined in <strong>Atharva Veda</strong> and
<strong>Manusmiriti</strong>, but in practice as well where parents insist to find
partners for their children regardless of their children's willingness.
In Indian arranged marriages, parents and family seem to play a key role
contrary to Western love marriages where only the couple is important.
So in a conclusive sense, one can say that &quot;an Indian arranged marriage
is a marriage of parents and family without much focus on the couple.&quot;</p>
<p>The 8 types of marriages---top 4 are accepted and bottom 4 are
forbidden---are following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brahma Vivaha:</strong> a similar tradition to modern Indian arranged
marriage, in which a well-educated (in Vedas) groom's parents seek
a suitable girl.</li>
<li><strong>Daiva Vivaha:</strong> A bride is donated to the priest as a part of
religious sacrifice.</li>
<li><strong>Arsha Vivaha:</strong> It includes donation (or modern dowry?) in
exchange for a bride.</li>
<li><strong>Prajapatya Vivaha:</strong> It is similar to <strong>Brahma Vivaha</strong> but in
this case the bride's parents seek a suitable guy, making it
inferior to <strong>Brahma Vivaha</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Gandharva Vivaha:</strong> Very similar to modern-day love marriages in
which lust or sexual attraction is the reason for the marriage.</li>
<li><strong>Asura Vivaha:</strong> A bridegroom pays a price to get the bride. It is
still in practice but only in rural areas. I have heard of 2 cases
in my locality.</li>
<li><strong>Raksasha Vivaha:</strong> This is a forced or kidnapped marriage. It is
interesting to know that in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_society_and_culture">Romanian
society</a> it is still popular.</li>
<li><strong>Paisacha Vivaha:</strong> It is the most sinful act, even mentioned in <strong>Manusmriti</strong>, in which a woman who
is asleep, intoxicated, or mentally challenged, is raped and therefore,s to preserve the honour
of woman it is regarded as a marriage.</li>
</ul>
