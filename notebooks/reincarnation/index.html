            <p>Reincarnation</p>
<p>It's a debatable topic as many cultures and philisophies including
<a href="charvaka">Charvaka</a> do not believe in it. I grew up listening
stories of reincarnation but they all seem just stories. The first
author I encountered about rebirth was an american psychologist <em>Brian
Weiss</em> whose experiences with his patients recalling some unknown
information in hypotherapy sessions lead him to conclude that the
patients have memories from past lives. However, it is unclear whether
that knowledge was merely an imagination or real past experiences. <em>Ian
Stevenson</em>, a canadian psychatrist, has presented a compelling arguement
in his book <em>Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation</em>. In this book, he
discussed twenty claims of rebirth, including the famous case of <em>Shanti
Devi</em>, which can not be easily dismissed. In addition, what amuzed me
that <em>Ian Stevenson</em> went to my hometown to study a case in 1966, which
is also discussed in his book.</p>
