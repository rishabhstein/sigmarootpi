<p>It's a debatable topic as many cultures and philisophies including <a href="Charvaka.html">Charvaka</a> do not believe in it. I grew up listening stories of reincarnation but they all seem just stories. The first author I encountered about rebirth was an american psychologist <i>Brian Weiss</i> whose experiences with his patients recalling some unknown information in hypotherapy sessions lead him to conclude that the patients have memories from past lives. However, it is unclear whether that knowledge was merely an imagination or real past experiences. <i>Ian Stevenson</i>, a canadian psychatrist, has presented a compelling arguement in his book <i>Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation</i>. In this book, he discussed twenty claims of rebirth, including the famous case of <i>Shanti Devi</i>, which can not be easily dismissed. In addition, what amuzed me that <i>Ian Stevenson</i> went to my hometown to study a case in 1966, which is also discussed in his book.</p>
