	Some comments for the critism on PhD thesis writing on Academia Stack Exchange <a href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/145912/how-to-to-deal-with-advisors-criticism-of-my-writing">[Link]</a>
	<ul>
	<li>
		It would be a mistake to interpret <b>criticism</b> as <i>assertion that you're failing</i>. Rather, <u>it is a constructive response to the work you've done so far.</u>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		Ultimately, <u>you may never produce anything that makes your advisor completely happy</u>. You are different people. The objective is to produce clear, readable papers, not to mimic perfectly your advisor's style.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		I suggest dealing with his comments in two phases. During the first phase, look for comments that are about what you are saying, and firmly ignore any comments about how you are saying it.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
		<b>Revisions?</b> <u>It's not oh, you are wrong/bad/evil/stupid</u>, but more like <i>you can do better at this point</i> and better serve yourself, make a better impression, be more successful with other people.
	</li>
