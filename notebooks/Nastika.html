<p>These are a collection of notes that I felt are worth keeping to recall information whenever I need it as quickly as possible. The material in these notebooks is mostly of my interest without any intention of being useful for others. Of course, in one lifetime, I could be an expert in maybe nothing. So it may offend other experts, for which you have my sincere apology in advance.</p>

<p>The topics are very diverse, ranging from myths, witches, and giants to philosophy and physics. In other words, whatever I found amusing, beautiful, strange, outrageous, weird, or otherwise noteworthy; things I want to learn and a list of references related to my research.</p>

<p>The format of these notebooks is copied from <a href="https://www.refsmmat.com/notebooks/">Alex Reinhart</a> and <a href="http://bactra.org/notebooks/">Cosma Shalizi</a>. I will modify them later, but I am deeply grateful for these guys to come up with such a nice idea.</p>
