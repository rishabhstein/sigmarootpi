  Welcome to my page. I am a Ph.D. student of <a href="https://fuw.edu.pl">Physics</a> in <a href ="https://en.uw.edu.pl">University of Warsaw</a>. My PhD thesis is about pattern formation in dissolving rocks. In carbonate rocks, a reactant such as acid rain, in certain physical conditions, can form highly conductive flow channels known as wormholes&mdash;not the ones related to Einstein's general relativity theory. In nature, these patterns are typically known as karst features. Some commonly known examples are <b>caves</b>, <b>solution pipes</b> and <b>sink-holes</b>

        Dissolution patterns
    </h2>
    <div>
        <p align="justify">
            Pattern formation in nature is a ubiquitous phenomenon which is observed in a variety of systems, with examples ranging from bacteria colony growth in biology to river networks and mineral dendrites in geology to Rayleigh-Taylor fingers observed in the Crab Nebula in cosmology. In geology, another example of pattern formation is dissolution patterns, which are the result of chemical erosion (dissolution) of carbonate rocks by a reactant. Dissolution is a highly non-linear process in which the interplay of flow, reaction and transport give rise to dissolution instabilities, which, in certain physical conditions, can evolve into distinct finger-like shapes. The figure below shows the dissolution fingers or solution pipes observed in Smerdyna, Poland (left) and Apuglia, Italy (middle panel). The right panel shows a wormhole in laboratory experiments. Note that the laboratory wormhole is only 11cm long compared to the natural patterns, whose size is in meters.

Wormholes provide highly efficient flow and transport paths within the rock, and as such, understanding their formation is critical for controlling contaminant migration or preventing CO2 leakage during geological carbon sequestration. Here, using time-resolved X-ray tomography, we capture the dynamics of wormhole propagation, inaccessible by standard experimental methods. We find a highly non-trivial relationship between wormhole advancement and variations in the permeability of the rock, with extensive periods of steady advancement not reflected by significant changes in permeability. This is in contrast to most existing conceptual models, where wormholes advance in a linear fashion. We show that this is caused by the presence of highly cemented regions which act as barriers to flow, as confirmed by multi-scale analysis of the pore geometry based on tomographic, (ultra) small angle neutron scattering, and optical microscopy measurements. These results demonstrate that time-lapse-captured wormhole dynamics can be used to probe the internal structure of the rock.

      Effect of pore-scale mixing

The formation and growth of dissolution patterns is a complex phenomenon in which the processes taking place at the micro-scale are strongly coupled with the macro-scale patterns. One of these processes is the mixing of reactant-saturated water at pore intersections. In this paper, we study how the intensity of the mixing process impacts the shapes and growth velocities of the dissolution channels. We find that when the mixing at pore intersections is relatively weak, the flow focuses more strongly in front of the wormhole tip, which reduces the width of the wormhole and leads to its faster propagation and early breakthrough. These effects are also evident from tracer breakthrough curves. Our findings contribute to the understanding of dissolution-induced patterns, with implications to subsurface flow-related processes such as karst formation and contaminant migration.

        Effect of dissolution on the pore geometry of rock

            Dissolution patterns, once formed, also alter the pore space permanently. There are several experimental studies to investigate the pore space evolution in laboratory experiments. However, there is a very limited understanding of pore-space change in natural dissolution. This could be because, in most cases, the host rock undergoes a complete transformation and erodes completely. In this project, we study the pore-space change of rock using Image-analysis methods. We develop methods for qualitative and quantitative assessment of pore geometry transformation within a rock as a result of karstification. We then apply these tools to characterize dissolution-induced changes in limestone samples collected from a quarry in Smerdyna (Poland), where intense epikarst development is observed, consisting of a large number of solution pipes. This characterization is complemented by the calculation of connectivity of the pore space as well as their flow characteristics. All of the results consistently indicate an important role of pore merging and inhomogeneous dissolution in the process of natural dissolution for the analyzed samples.
