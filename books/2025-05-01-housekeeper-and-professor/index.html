<p>This is a translated version of an original review written in <a href="/books/2025-05-01-housekeeper-and-professor-hi/">Hindi</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine meeting a person whose memory lasts only 80 minutes, and after that, he forgets everything. In such a situation, every time you meet him, it will be as if you're meeting for the very first time. This is a fascinating and strange concept, one that feels unusual even in imagination. Films like Ghajini and Memento have been made on similar ideas. Today‚Äôs story is also somewhat like that‚Äîwritten by the renowned Japanese author <em>Yoko Ogawa</em>. What sets it apart from other stories is that it is narrated by a character in such a way that it feels as if the character himself is writing the book</p>
<p>The story begins when a cleaning company sends one of its female employees to work as a maid, taking care of a mathematics professor. This professor is the one whose memory lasts only 80 minutes. However, the mathematician has found a unique solution to his limited memory problem: he writes important information in short words, numbers, or diagrams on small notes and sticks them onto his coat. These notes remind him of what has already happened.</p>
<p>The first time the maid goes to meet the professor, he neither greets her nor asks her name. Instead, he asks for her shoe size and her date of birth. This seems just as strange to the maid as it does to the reader, but based on her past experiences‚Äîwhich have been even more unusual‚Äîshe accepts the incident as fairly normal. Gradually, the maid begins to understand the professor's love for mathematics and algebra, and her respect for him grows. She not only starts to grasp the depth of mathematics but also begins to see the beauty of number theory. Alongside this, a friendship also develops between the professor and the maid‚Äôs son‚Äîwho is just 8 to 10 years old‚Äîand the professor‚Äôs social loneliness and personal charm begin to surface. But life takes a turn, and this relationship inevitably comes to an end due to professional boundaries. Despite its many ups and downs, the story ends on a beautiful and emotional note, leaving the reader caught in thought between mathematics and emotion.</p>
<p>The author has written this story with great beauty and simplicity. While reading it, I often felt as though I were truly reading a memoir. Weaving a complex subject like mathematics into emotions is no easy task, but the author has done it remarkably well. This book never creates a divide between those who know mathematics and those unfamiliar with it, and in my opinion, it is engaging for both groups alike.</p>
<p>The flow of Japanese stories is generally slow, which might feel boring to today‚Äôs stimulation-seeking audience. This story also unfolds gradually and at times brings a sense of monotony. The use of mathematics is limited here to number theory, which is accessible to general readers, but not particularly unique. Many popular films and books also restrict their portrayal of mathematics to number theory. Ultimately, it‚Äôs a short book that can easily be finished during a single journey. So, if you're looking to read something different and are not afraid of mathematics, this story is for you.</p>

            <p>&quot;The truth is often painful and disturbing, and if we try to make it more comforting and flattering, it will no longer be the truth.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Truth, then, isn‚Äôt a one-to-one representation of reality.
